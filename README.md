Student Software Engineers for Launchpad â€“ Recruitment Test


to access functionality, login (/Account/Login) is required, then return to the homepage (/home) and use buttons from there.

you can currently register as admin, existing log in for admin:
username:TestUserName
password:testPassword

for time constraints, shortlists and reports were not completed (though some similar view and delete functionality is used in view user lists (Account/userIndex) for viewing and deleting database entries.

to save file size, only 2 models are included, to add more models, log in as admin
